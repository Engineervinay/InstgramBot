Instagram Bot which increases your followers.The objective of this project is to build a bigger audience and as a plus, maybe drive some traffic to your website.The script isn’t as sophisticated as it could be, and I know there’s lots of room to improve it. 

if you search for 'how to grow on Instagram' you can see the results like , engage with the peoples in your niche,use hashtags, etc. 
This Bot will help you to get good Instagram followers and customers by liking and commenting on the post of hashtag specified.
there are many bots available online but they are not free.

-Popamatic     :-$39 per month
-Followadder  :-$49-$425 per 6 months

Because of mistakes made by developer a lot of account gets ban for using Instagram Bots.
Uploading your Instagram user id and password is also not the safe thing to do.
That's why I developed an Instagram Bot to do the Work for You.


The Bot is Developed Using Python 3 
 ## Requirment
  Python3,Selenium, a browser (in my case I’ll be using Chrome) and obviously, an Instagram account!


## Working:-
**you have to customize paths in the code according to your browser**
- Open a browser and login with your credentials
- For every hashtag in the hashtag list, it will open the page and click the first picture to open it
- It will then like, comment and move to the next picture, in a 100 iterations loop (number can be adjusted)
